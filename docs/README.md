# SIMS-Project
The project is to build a Student Information Management System (SIMS) in JavaScript. It will let users add, display, or remove student names, show the total number of students, get a name by position, and join names into one string. It will also check if the class is empty or not.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-The Student Information Management System is a simple web-based tool to manage a list of student names.
It allows you to add, remove, view, and check student records using interactive buttons.
